                              <p>As families, we all want the right fit for our children. We believe, like you, that the school experience does not have to mean a lack of outdoor time, movement/physical education, mindfulness, socio-emotional development, foreign language, family involvement, and recognition of spirit at the heart of childhood. In fact, we see it as  just the opposite. We are therefore a teacher-led, parent-powered Montessori school offering small class sizes for students in kindergarten.</p>
                              <p>Located in Kilimani/Lavington area in Nairobi, Kenya, Gates and Bridges Academy has Preschool YEAR 1(3 -4Years), YEAR 2(4-5Years), YEAR 3 (5-6Years). Each class has a lead teacher providing instruction across the curriculum which includes: Math, Language, Culture, Sensorial, and Practical Life.</p>
                              <p>Our classes hold a maximum of 15 students that allow for daily outdoor explorations in all seasons, connecting the child to their daily program of study. Children start each day with a morning circle for devotions. They enjoy [Language] instruction, movement opportunities with instruction in a variety of activities such as soccer, dance, ballet, swimming, music instruments and foreign languages( Chineses, French, Spanish, Swahili and some vernaculars).  Field trips once a term add to their classwork with experiences such as a day at Zoo, or a shamba (farm).</p>

                                                      <p>You will find small, mixed-age classes that offer the chance for plenty of individual attention; an emphasis on community building, movement, and nature; immersive, hands-on, theme-based learning; field trips that take advantage of both the natural and cultural resources in the Nairobi communities; and, of course, opportunities for parent and family involvement. We truly believe that children learn better when their families are involved and invested in their educations, and we see school as both a connection to, and a widening of, the childâ€™s home community and family experience.</p>

                                                      <p>Yes. We wholeheartedly believe that arts, nature, and movement are critical elements to educating the whole child. Arts are integrated holistically into the academic curriculum. Physical education takes place through outdoor play, movement classes, nature walks, or sports classes at the nearby recreation center (including swimming lessons). In addition, our curriculum is supplemented with frequent field trips to museums, theaters, and cultural centers.</p>

To assess progress, Gates and Bridges Academy parents can expect to receive a qualitative progress report at the end of each semester. Parents can also expect an open and communicative relationship with their teacher.

                                                      We do use adaptive diagnostic tools?? to help us know where each child has learning challenges and strengths in reading and math.</p>

                                                      <p>There are multiple benefits to a mixed-age classroom, which are discussed in detail here. In general, our teacher will teach to the entire class, scaling the actual classwork to the abilities of the individual students. For example, an older child might write a page-long essay about a work of art, whereas a younger child might write a few sentences. Math is the only class where lessons are differentiated by ability and taught in small groups or one-on-one.</p>
